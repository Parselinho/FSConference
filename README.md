in lines 129 - 138 I added valid and not valid functions, the valid function add validation to the classlist and removing any error text, while the notvalid do the 
opposite. 

i use those 2 functions 'all in' to check all the inputs (except the activities) in the change event listener and the keyup eventlistener. 

in the keyup eventlistener i wanted to specifay everything that need to be filled out so i 'triggered' all the errors\not-valid messages.


I also used a real time valiidation and added conditional error message: the email input field uses real time validation and conditional error message,
when the input field is empty there is a text, and when you type something in the input field, the text change, to help you understand how your email should look like.
